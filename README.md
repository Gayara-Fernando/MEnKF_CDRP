# MEnKF_CDRP

## Introduction

This GitHub repository consists of codes used in "A Multi-arm ANN to combine information from multiple deep learners and attach uncertainty", by authors, Ved Piyush, Gayara Demini Fernando, Ruibo Zhang, M. Ryan Weil, Ranadip Pal, and Souparno Ghosh. 

## Data and Run help

## 1. MEnKF

The original codes for the MEnKF come from the repository https://github.com/Ved-Piyush/MEnKF_Ensembler_DualGCN_DeepCDR. 

### Training DeepCDR and DualGCN

To train the DeepCDR model, use the code [DeepCDR_Train](https://github.com/Gayara-Fernando/MEnKF_CDRP/blob/main/DeepCDR_Train.ipynb), and to train the DualGCN model, use the code [DualGCN_train](https://github.com/Gayara-Fernando/MEnKF_CDRP/blob/main/DualGCN_Train.ipynb). These codes are modified versions of the original codes at https://github.com/kimmo1019/DeepCDR and https://github.com/horsedayday/DualGCN by the original authors of the models.
